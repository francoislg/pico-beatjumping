# Beat Jumping

An attempt at making a game that produces music when playing it

Jumping makes a sound on a musical scale depending on the height of the map, and the goal is to catch all notes on the screen. 

Everything is on a single screen, so multiple routes are possibles (thus playing a different music)

## Controls

A to jump (hold to go further), arrows to control, down to fast-fall. Can wall-jump.

## Big Game Goals

1. Maps that are open and allow enough creativity, so that you can replay them to "sounds better"
2. Some ways to share or play back the creations

### My todo

## Objective #1 - Add music and other sounds

1. Add a backing track (simple beat)
2. Add a different sound when you press B for flourishes (should it jump as well or just play a sound..?)
3. Add minor/diminished/augmented chords (no UI, just config for now)
